\section{Introduction}
In an era characterized by rapid technological advancements, businesses are constantly seeking efficient, automated, and precise solutions to streamline their operations. This paradigm shift has led to the creation of numerous software programs tailored to meet the diverse needs of different industries, facilities, and various workplaces. Historically, manual methods were employed for data management, but evolving preferences have spurred a transition to digital solutions. Recognizing the digital divide prevalent among small businesses, particularly those serving local communities, this project, "Track My Shop," endeavors to empower these enterprises and enable their seamless integration into the online marketplace.

In today's digital landscape, the majority of businesses across sectors have embraced online platforms to market and sell their products and services, swiftly reaching customers through home deliveries. However, smaller businesses such as service providers, mini stores, repair shops, and local vendors, including cobblers, barbers, milk shops, bakeries, and spare parts shops, often find it financially challenging to establish an online presence. The "Track My Shop" web application sets out to address this disparity by providing local shops a centralized online platform to connect with their local customer base. Through this application, shopkeepers can significantly broaden their customer reach, attract a larger audience, and consequently, enhance their earnings with minimal effort of input.

The project envisions simplifying and modernizing operations for local businesses by integrating innovative features such as image recognition for effortless addition of products services, and image-based search capabilities for customers.

\section{Project Overview}
The proposed system, "Track My Shop," is a web-based application designed to facilitate the seamless creation of online shops for sellers. Utilizing image recognition technology, sellers can effortlessly add products or services to their online shop by capturing or uploading images. The system automatically identifies and categorizes the items, making them readily accessible to customers in the vicinity of the shop. Conversely, customers can easily browse and search for products or services using images, names, or proximity filters. They can initiate requests for product delivery or obtain directions to the seller's physical shop, enhancing their overall shopping experience.

\section{Problem Statement}
In the contemporary business landscape, small enterprises encounter a significant barrier in establishing an online platform for their operations due to prohibitive costs associated with web development and maintenance. The high financial investment required often restricts their ability to tap into the potential of the digital marketplace, limiting their growth and outreach.

Furthermore, the traditional method of manually inputting products and services into an online platform has become increasingly burdensome and time-consuming. This arduous process not only consumes valuable time but also poses a hindrance to the efficient management and scaling of businesses, leading to decreased productivity and suboptimal user experiences.

In addition, both customers and local shops face challenges in connecting efficiently. The conventional approach of physically visiting or relying on word-of-mouth recommendations to discover shops or services is cumbersome and time-intensive. This lack of a seamless and convenient means to connect customers with local shops impedes the potential for increased business transactions and growth for these small enterprises. Therefore, an effective solution is imperative to address these pressing issues and bridge the existing gap between small businesses and their online presence while enhancing accessibility and connectivity for both customers and shops.

\section{Study Limitations}
The primary challenges that impeded the advancement of this project were time and financial constraints. The project involved various financial obligations, including expenses for software development, server deployment, image recognition technology, and geolocation features. Additionally, managing fieldwork, development tasks, and adhering to project timelines was demanding. Despite these constraints, we remained committed to ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the web application, striving to meet the expectations and needs of both sellers and customers.

\section{Literature Review}
"Track My Shop" embodies the essence of modern business augmentation through technology. In an era where online presence is paramount, this web application offers a cost-effective solution for small and local businesses to establish their digital footprint. By seamlessly integrating products and services using image recognition and geolocation features, the application enhances accessibility and connectivity between customers and local shops. It paves the way for an intuitive and efficient shopping experience, bridging the gap between traditional brick-and-mortar stores and the vast digital market. The project encapsulates the vision of empowering businesses and customers alike, promoting growth, efficiency, and a seamless convergence of technology and commerce.
