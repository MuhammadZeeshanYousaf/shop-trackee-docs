\section{Development Stages }
Following are the stages of development:
\subsection{Strategy Stage}
We designed our web application while keeping in mind the requirements of our end sellers and customers. In order to make it a success we planned each and everything beforehand. We have learned our users demand and then planned our project on it. We have designed it in such a way that it can be easy to use and handle. After jotting down our requirements we made diagrams so that it can give an outlook of our system. After this we worked on our database and later on its implementation. We also wrote the project code, then we integrated and tested our it to verify if its working.

\section{Implementation}

\section{System Integration}
System integration in the "Track My Shop" project is a critical process where all the individual components and modules of the system are combined and tested to ensure they function as a unified, cohesive unit. This integration involves merging the backend functionalities, including database management and server operations, with the frontend user interface to create a seamless and functional application. The integration process also incorporates third-party services, such as image recognition, mapping APIs and Deployment on AWS/Heroku, ensuring their proper interaction within the application. Rigorous testing and validation are conducted to confirm that the integrated system operates smoothly, with data flowing seamlessly between various components.\\
Achieving a successful integration is vital for delivering a reliable, efficient, and feature-rich web application that can be run on any environment and on any web browser, meets the needs and expectations of both sellers and customers. 

\section{User Interface}
The user interface (UI) of the "Track My Shop" project is crafted to deliver a seamless and engaging experience for both sellers and customers. Sellers are provided with a comprehensive dashboard offering insights into their shops, order requests, and sales statistics. They can efficiently manage their shop listings, adding new products/services and updating existing ones. On the other hand, customers are greeted with an intuitive interface that allows effortless browsing of nearby shops and their offerings, categorized for easy exploration. The search functionality is versatile, enabling customers to search by text, images, or based on their preferences. Clear product/service details, interactive maps for shop locations, easy order request processes, and a user-friendly profile management system further enhance the overall usability. The UI is designed to be accessible and responsive to various type of devices and user needs, ultimately fostering a positive and satisfying interaction for all users.
