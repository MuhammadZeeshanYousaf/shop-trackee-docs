\section{Development Stages }
Following are the stages of development:
\subsection{Strategy Stage}
We designed our web application while keeping in mind the requirements of our end sellers and customers. In order to make it a success we planned each and everything beforehand. We have learned our users demand and then planned our project on it. We have designed it in such a way that it can be easy to use and handle. After jotting down our requirements we made diagrams so that it can give an outlook of our system. After this we worked on our database and later on its implementation. We also wrote the project code, then we integrated and tested our it to verify if its working.

\section{Implementation}
Following is described about the implementation level things:

\section{System Integration}
System integration in the "Track My Shop" project is a critical process where all the individual components and modules of the system are combined and tested to ensure they function as a unified, cohesive unit. This integration involves merging the backend functionalities, including database management and server operations, with the frontend user interface to create a seamless and functional application. The integration process also incorporates third-party services, such as image recognition, mapping APIs and Deployment on AWS/Heroku, ensuring their proper interaction within the application. Rigorous testing and validation are conducted to confirm that the integrated system operates smoothly, with data flowing seamlessly between various components.\\
Achieving a successful integration is vital for delivering a reliable, efficient, and feature-rich web application that can be run on any environment and on any web browser, meets the needs and expectations of both sellers and customers. 

\section{User Interface}
The user interface (UI) of the "Track My Shop" project is crafted to deliver a seamless and engaging experience for both sellers and customers. Sellers are provided with a comprehensive dashboard offering insights into their shops, order requests, and sales statistics. They can efficiently manage their shop listings, adding new products/services and updating existing ones. On the other hand, customers are greeted with an intuitive interface that allows effortless browsing of nearby shops and their offerings, categorized for easy exploration. The search functionality is versatile, enabling customers to search by text, images, or based on their preferences. Clear product/service details, interactive maps for shop locations, easy order request processes, and a user-friendly profile management system further enhance the overall usability. The UI is designed to be accessible and responsive to various type of devices and user needs, ultimately fostering a positive and satisfying interaction for all users.

\section{Evaluation}
Each element of our website is meticulously designed based on the findings of Market Shop Sellers and Customer Research, which takes into account criteria such as technical knowledge, and comprehension.The user is given a seamless experience, allowing them to easily see, update, upload, and manage their data. While designing the website, Human Computer Interaction concepts were taken into account, allowing the user to see where they are presently working and easy to use. Before releasing the website, we make sure that all of the tabs and buttons are visible and double-checked and everything is working properly. Once the website is ready for the user, it will be extensively tested and any necessary changes will be done. Hence the website is user friendly and unambiguous.

\end{table}

We assume in Table 4.1 the first row shows the time when the transition occur, second row represents the run $r*_{group}$, third row corresponds to the satisfied propositions, and last three rows shows the separate run of these three robots. We observed in the optimal run that ($q_0$,$q_0$,$q_0$), ($q_1$,$q_1$,$q_1$), ($q_1$$q_0$1,$q_2$,$q_3$) is prefix and ($q_0$,$q_1$,$q_2$), ($q_1$,$q_0$,$q_3$) is suffix cycle and that will be repeated an infinite number of times. The given time which satisfies the $\sigma$ is $\mathbb{T^\sigma}$ = \{2,4,6,8,10,\dots\} and the function defined in (3.2) is $C(\mathbb{T})$ = 2.

Now, the time sequence when $\sigma$ is repeatedly satisfied is $\mathbb{T^\sigma}$ = \{2,4,6,8,10,\dots\} and cost function is given as;

 \hspace{30pt}  $C(\mathbb{T})$ = $\lim_{k\to+\infty}$ ($\mathbb{T}$(k+1) - $\mathbb{T}$(k))

\hspace{30pt}  = $\mathbb{T}$(k+1) - $\mathbb{T}$(k)

\hspace{30pt}  = 4 - 2 = 2

 As $C(\mathbb{T})$ = 2 is the obtained function where the $\sigma$ is repeatedly satisfied. At t=3, robot2 has reached at $q_2$ while the robot1 is still moving from $q_1$ to $q_0$, therefore $r_1$* has no correlated state to t=3.

 \subsection{Accurate Specified Run}
 In Algorithm.2 the exact solution is summarized and it shows that a particular solution is given to a specified problem for that case where robots have exact time information.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{12cm}| }
 \hline
 \textbf{Algorithm 2:} Accurate-Run \\ \hline
\textbf{ Input:} \{$T_1$,$T_2$, $T_3$\} \& LTL formula $\phi$. \\
  \textbf{Result:} Different runs of each system in the form \{$r_1$*,$r_2$*,$r_3$*\} that satisfies $\phi$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item n = 1, 2, 3
    \item Model the group transition system \textbf{T}.
    \item Now search runs $r*_{group}$ for the system as done in Table.1.
    \item Trace runs $r*_{group}$ on the transition systems $T_n$ to obtain the runs $r_n$*.
    \item Then find obtained function where $\sigma$ is satisfied.
  \end{enumerate}
 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As the grouped transition system \textbf{T} is constructed by using Algorithm.1 to model the team. After that we obtain a run $r*_{group}$ on \textbf{T} that satisfies the LTL formula.

\vspace{10pt}
Now similarly in Table 4.2 the first row shows the time when the transition occur, second row represents the run $r*_{group}$, third row corresponds to the satisfied propositions, and last three rows shows the separate run of three robots. As we observed in the optimal run that ($q_0$,$q_0$,$q_0$), ($q_1$,$q_1$,$q_1$) is the prefix and ($q_1$$q_0$1,$q_2$,$q_3$), ($q_0$,$q_1$,$q_2$), ($q_0$$q_1$1,$q_2$,$q_3$), ($q_1$,$q_1$,$q_1$) is the suffix cycle and that will be repeated an infinite number of times. The given time which satisfies the $\sigma$ is $\mathbb{T^\sigma}$ = \{2,4,6,8,10,\dots\} and the function defined in (3.2) is $C(\mathbb{T})$ = 2.

Now as we done in Table 4.1 similarly the same procedure for this run shown in Table 4.2, the time sequence when $\sigma$ is repeatedly satisfied is $\mathbb{T^\sigma}$ = \{2,4,6,8,10,\dots\} and cost function is given as;

\hspace{30pt}  $C(\mathbb{T})$ = $\lim_{k\to+\infty}$ ($\mathbb{T}$(k+1) - $\mathbb{T}$(k))

\hspace{30pt}  = $\mathbb{T}$(k+1) - $\mathbb{T}$(k)

\hspace{30pt}  = 4 - 2 = 2

 As $C(\mathbb{T})$ = 2 is the obtained function where the $\sigma$ is repeatedly satisfied.

 For some applications including new states and corresponding transitions to the structure of the robotic system may indicate to introducing advance stages or motion commands at some lower level. So the proper way in which the changes of these models are strictly application specific and we do not consider such details in our work. Assuming that these changes can be implemented in future.

 \subsection{Synchronized Specification}
 If there is a situation in which robots are moving at uncertain time and $\phi$ is not satisfied then we consider individual synchronization run for the robots that helps in guarantee the correctness of the model. In Algorithm.3 the protocols which is followed by the robots for synchronization in the field.

 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{13cm}| }
 \hline
 \textbf{Algorithm 3:} Synchronized-Move \\ \hline
\textbf{ Input:} $r_i$ and sequence $s_i$ of $robot_i$ \\
  \textbf{Result:} Simple synchronized moves for each robot that satisfies $\phi$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initialized z at 0 and while True do
  \end{itemize}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item report all the members.
    \item wait until all members received their information message.
    \item after satisfying propositions at $r_i^{z}$ create a transition to $r_i^{z+1}$.
    \item z = z+1.
  \end{enumerate}
 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
